## Who am i?

Hi there! My name is Lucas and I'm a datatechnician with a specialty in infrastructure apprenticeship at Siemens Gamesa. In my current job, I work with Linux, Kubernetes, and CI/CD on a daily basis, constantly expanding my knowledge and skill set in these areas.

At just 20 years old, I'm still relatively new to the professional world, but I'm eager to learn and grow in my career. In my free time, I like to hone my coding skills by working on personal projects and writing code for my own hobby blog. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise, and I'm excited to see where my career takes me in the years to come.

Thanks for taking the time to get to know a little bit about me!
